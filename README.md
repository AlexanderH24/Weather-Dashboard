# Weather-Dashboard

This could have been done several different ways. Started by understanding how to create the main card using the weather?q=, but could have used forecast?q= for a single weather request. I also took the forecast response and broke it down to display 5 days with list [i * 8]. If i were to rework this, I would figure out how to look for 1500 in each of the 40 objects in list, and solve for the city validation. With more time, I would make it look/feel less rough.
